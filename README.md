꘎♡━━━♡꘎ Welcome! ꘎♡━━━♡꘎ 

This is my site that showcases both
my abilities in art and my abilities 
in coding so far! I wanted an easy way
to make my wealth of skills marketable 
to whomever I may need to. What easier 
way than to demonstrate them all in one
place? 	(´｡• ᵕ •｡`) ♡

I didn't make it quite as far as
 I would've liked due to personal 
 problems, but I'm still quite pleased 
 with the end result and with myself 
 for sticking with things despite all 
 my struggling IRL. This will eventually 
 be my dream site and my new internet 
 home, but for now, this'll do! I'm 
 proud of all the learning I've done, 
 hehe~ (￣▽￣*)ゞ

I made an interactive art gallery, thanks
to various tutorials, which I've always 
wanted to do! I also included the over-
arching requirements, like two media 
queries, a grid layout, a header, 
footer, and body, and I did my best to 
implement semantic HTML. 

I also threw in a responsive menu 
created with JavaScript, a transition
animation to an element on hover, and 
an accordion box! I think that hopefully
covers everything!!

To see my site in live action, please 
head to: 

I hope you enjoy perusing my works, and
most importantly, enjoy your stay!
Have a nice day~!
